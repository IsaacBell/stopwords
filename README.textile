h1. STOPWORDS

h2. REALLY JUST A LIST OF STOPWORDS WITH SOME HELPERS

Obviously part of something bigger but worth breaking out for reuse. 

h2. USAGE

<pre><code>
	
require 'stopwords'

#List all stop words
Stopwords::STOP_WORDS

#Test to see if a token is a stop word
Stopwords.is?('and')

=>true

#Ensures a token is both a 'word' and not a stop word
Stopwords.valid?('vector')

=>true

</code></pre>

h2. SPECS

<pre><code>
$ rake specs
</code></pre>

h2. SANITIZE

Not part of the library but you should probably sanitize tokens before using them (if your tokenize doesn't already)

<pre><code>
SANITIZE_REGEXP = /('|\"|‘|’|\/|\\)/
text.downcase.gsub(SANITIZE_REGEXP, '')
</code></pre>
